# UX Designer and Web Developer

Hi there! My name is Luxuon and I am a computer science student specializing in UX design and front end web development and growing into much more!

* I have a strong passion for creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences.

* currently, I have been working long hours on my portfolio to apply at Riot Games as an intern for UX design.

* I have experience using a variety of design and development tools, including Figma and Webflow. 

* I have used these tools to design and develop a range of web and mobile applications, from simple landing pages to full-featured e-commerce platforms.

* In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong understanding of user experience design principles and a keen eye for detail.

* I am able to translate complex technical concepts into easy-to-understand visuals and interactive prototypes.
