# UX Designer and Web Developer

Hi there! My name is Luxuon and I am a computer science student specializing in UX design and front end web development and growing into much more!

* I have a strong passion for creating user-friendly and visually appealing digital experiences.

* Currently, I am my school's E-Sports supervisor/Gaming Community manager and have been working on creating designs for marketing purposes.

* I have experience using a variety of design and development tools, including Figma and Webflow. 

* I have used these tools to design and develop a range of web and mobile applications, from simple landing pages to full-featured e-commerce platforms.

* In addition to my technical skills, I have a strong understanding of user experience design principles and a keen eye for detail.

* I am able to translate complex technical concepts into easy-to-understand visuals and interactive prototypes.

* My current goal is to become an intern at riot and I hope I will be able to make it!
  
* I am also a huge gamer at heart and would love to meet fellow gaming devs!
